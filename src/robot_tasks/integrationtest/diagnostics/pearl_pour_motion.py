"""Engineering motion fixture for L2-04; never imported by a task/policy.

Uses measured cup-to-hand geometry to qualify physical reach, grip, pouring and
release through the production planner. It does NOT test a model's perception
or decisions. No cup pose writes, grasp attachments, disabled collisions or
scripted benchmark results. l2_execution_probe owns lifecycle and recording.
