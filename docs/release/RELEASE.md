# Source, assets and project page

## Deliverable layout

`python tools/release/package.py --output dist` builds:

- `r5-benchmark-source.tar.gz`: maintained code, all task configurations, tests,
  release documentation, optional deployment skill, site and the runtime asset lock. No `.git` history,
  credentials, host-local config, environments, runs, reports or caches.
- `r5-benchmark-assets.tar.gz`: every file in `assets/runtime.lock.json`, including
  all references, source layers, textures and upstream notices.
- `release.json`: SHA-256 and size of both archives, plus per-source-file hashes.

Extract source into a new directory. Install its matching asset archive with
`tools/release/install_assets.py`; the installer validates all paths, sizes and
hashes before replacing runtime inputs. Do not use an older Tuojing package as
a substitute. Asset installation should occur while that checkout is idle.

The main Git repository pins two optional public submodules: `assets/` for simulation inputs and `docs/media/` for website media. Initialize both before building the complete release archives:

```bash
git submodule update --init assets docs/media
python tools/verify_runtime_assets.py --check-git --usd
python tools/release/package.py --output dist
```

The unpacked paths, asset hashes and website URLs are unchanged. Git metadata is excluded from asset verification and archives. Git LFS is not required. A normal Git clone does not download either submodule; the separately built source archive includes website media and the runtime asset lock, and the matching asset archive restores the simulation inputs. GitHub’s automatic source ZIP does not include submodules.

For a resource update, commit and push the changed files in the appropriate resource repository first, then commit its new gitlink in the main repository. Publish the reviewed resource pin together with the code. Preserve upstream notices and media provenance. Do not replace an asset lock to conceal a change to an experimental condition.

## Fresh-checkout acceptance

1. Extract the source archive into a clean directory outside the development tree.
2. Restore its matching assets and verify `verify_runtime_assets.py --usd`.
3. Install `.[test]`, run CPU tests, task-contract check and offline dry runs.
4. Configure external Isaac/cuRobo installations; capture all 32 initial states.
5. Compare task fingerprints and asset hashes with the frozen pre-release baseline.
6. Archive verification output separately; no model call is needed for these checks.

Initial-state validation is not a claim that a model can solve every task.
A paper result reproduction additionally requires the chosen model access and
full episodes under the stated budgets.

## GitHub Pages

`docs/` is buildless HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Its actual simulator images are local
WebP derivatives; source assets and simulation rendering remain untouched.

A 60-second project film sits between the homepage cover and affiliation logos.
It opens on the unchanged paper Figure 1, which also leads the README.
Full-resolution PNG and vector PDF links remain available.
The film previews silently without transport controls and opens a native-controls
player on click. Offscreen/background playback and reduced-motion preferences
are respected. `docs/media/promo/sources.json` records the source excerpts;
`tools/site/build_project_film.py` renders the film from those recordings and
timed narration. The approved presentation refinement uses
`tools/site/refine_project_film.py` with the original film from release `d30871c`:
paired views retain their positions, chart bars follow the narration, and chapter
transitions use short fades. `docs/media/promo/refinement.json` records the edit
and input hash. The original narration and caption timing are preserved.
Downloaded source recordings are not retained in the repository.
`docs/media/paper/source.json` records its source hash,
page crop and verification against the current paper.

```bash
git submodule update --init docs/media
python -m http.server 8000 --directory docs
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. The PhysLadder page includes an interactive particle constellation, a compact sixteen-task
simulation/real-robot video montage, individual paired excerpts, and a downloadable
GIF. The hero uses the paper’s complete title and subtitle. An interactive ARX R5
gripper is drawn from 7,400 points and contour edges sampled from the pinned
manufacturer CAD (`link6`–`link8`), with drag/keyboard rotation, hover connections
and a normalized opening control. It shares the page’s motion preference, pauses
when offscreen, and includes a static SVG fallback. Regenerate the presentation
assets with `python tools/site/build_gripper_art.py`; runtime assets remain unchanged.
Source hashes and illustration boundaries are recorded in
`docs/media/gripper/sources.json`. Task filters, original/variant comparison, three camera views and copy buttons
work without a backend. The sim–real matching section adds nine paired views from paper
Figure 5: workspace, initial nut engagement, ARX R5 embodiment, three camera
observations, measured marker length and jelly mass. The title-page institution
marks appear as author affiliations below the hero. Motion pauses outside the viewport or in background tabs;
reduced-motion preferences disable automatic animation and playback. The task catalogue is in
`tasks.json`; `tasks.js` also allows opening the page directly from disk.

GitHub Pages publishes directly from the `master` branch's `/docs` folder.
The Pages build fetches the public HTTPS submodules from `.gitmodules`;
`docs/media` must remain present at that path. Keep the resource repositories
public and verify images and video playback after publishing a changed pin.
Use **Deploy from a branch**, select `master` and `/docs`, and keep `docs/CNAME`
and `docs/.nojekyll` in the release. No secondary deployment branch or custom
Actions workflow is needed. The website and code share one release snapshot;
update website files in `docs/` and publish the reviewed `master` release.
Editor settings and custom Actions workflows are omitted from the public release.
The project page is hosted at <https://physladder-benchmark.com/>. The custom
domain and HTTPS remain configured in Pages; DNS is managed by the domain provider.
The homepage and README link to the [paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.34527).
Historical media provenance can refer to the earlier `site/` location; those
original names and hashes are preserved. Active generators write to `docs/`.

Design references: [RoboCasa](https://robocasa.ai/),
[BEHAVIOR](https://behavior.stanford.edu/index.html), and
[Gemini Robotics](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini-robotics/).
The layout, particle graphics and code are original. Project-owned experiment
recordings supply the looping media. Institution marks and paired matching images
are reproduced from the authors’ supplied paper, with provenance in
`docs/media/affiliations/sources.json` and `docs/media/alignment/sources.json`.
Institution marks identify author affiliations, not institutional endorsement.
Camera examples preserve the paper’s timing caveats; no exact intrinsic
calibration is claimed. AI-generated appearance composites from Figure 5(b3)
are excluded. The hardware is identified as ARX R5 (方舟).
`docs/media/loops/sources.json` records the original filenames, SHA-256 hashes,
selected eight-second windows and overview-camera crops. These are presentation
excerpts, with no additional speed changes; the two domains have independent
timelines and outcome labels refer to full trials. The downloadable GIF and MP4
montage combine all thirty-two excerpts. The overview uses four task columns on
desktop and two on mobile; selecting a task opens its paired clips. Rebuild the
montages with `python tools/site/build_film_montage.py --ffmpeg /path/to/ffmpeg`. The marble-pouring simulation excerpt uses
the first trial (12/12 marbles received), replacing the second trial with spillage.
Source recordings are kept in the materials
document; temporary local downloads are removed after derivative verification.

## Licenses and provenance

Team-owned code is Apache-2.0, approved by the project owner. On 2026-10-21 the
owner also confirmed public redistribution permission for all supplied assets.
Third-party notices remain in place; `NOTICE` and `asset_permissions.json` keep
that confirmation distinct from each upstream license. Isaac and cuRobo remain
external dependencies. Historical local paths in provenance metadata are source
lineage, not runtime installation requirements.

Before public push, review the prepared source rather than pushing an old Git
history that may contain private material. `package.py` never copies Git history.
Paper author list, permanent paper link and final result tables can be supplied
later without altering task definitions.
