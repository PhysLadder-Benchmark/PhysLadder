## Overview

PhysLadder evaluates contact-rich manipulation across **16 tasks**, **three levels** of interaction difficulty, and matched simulation and real-world setups on the **ARX R5** dual-arm platform.

This repository provides the simulation framework, task assets, configurations, and automatic evaluators. Each task has an independently selectable original and fixed alternative configuration, giving **32 runnable settings**. The project page brings together paired recordings, sim–real matching details, and an interactive task explorer.

## Benchmark

| Level | Interaction requirement | Tasks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L1** | Contact selection and geometric alignment | Marker Placement · Charger Alignment · Hat Hanging · Cup Nesting · Flower Transfer |
| **L2** | Force regulation during sustained contact | Marker Cap Removal · Book Pulling · Marble Pouring · Orange Handling · Drawer Pull & Return · Jelly Handling · Whiteboard Wiping |
| **L3** | Coordinated contact reconfiguration and force regulation | Bottle Cap Removal · Nut Removal · Stacked-Book Pushing & Rotation · Block Sweeping |

Current task IDs and historical mappings are documented in the [task numbering guide](docs/release/TASK_NUMBERING.md). Original and `variant01` settings are separate experiments; alternative settings are not uniformly position-only changes. Some L3 variants also differ in scoring or budget. See the [evaluation protocol](docs/release/PROTOCOL.md) for the exact settings.

## Quick start

### 1. Install the framework

Use Python 3.11 and an editable source checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhysLadder-Benchmark/PhysLadder.git
cd PhysLadder
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
```

On Windows, create the environment with `py -3.11 -m venv .venv` and activate it with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` in PowerShell.

### 2. Download assets and inspect an experiment

The initial clone contains source code and documentation. Download the pinned simulation assets when needed; website media is optional for simulation. These checks and execution plans run on a CPU without calling a model:

```bash
git submodule update --init assets
python tools/verify_runtime_assets.py --usd
python tools/release/check_task_contract.py
python tools/launch.py list
python tools/reproduce.py --tasks L2-02 L2-02_variant01
```

To preview or edit the project page, download its media separately:

```bash
git submodule update --init docs/media
python -m http.server 8000 --directory docs
```

Use `git clone --recurse-submodules` to download both sets at once. GitHub’s **Download ZIP** does not include submodule contents; use a Git clone or a packaged source release with its matching asset archive, as described in [Installation](docs/release/INSTALL.md).

### 3. Run in simulation

Simulation requires **NVIDIA Isaac Sim 5.1**, a compatible **NVIDIA GPU**, the separate pinned **cuRobo** environment, and model access. Follow [Installation](docs/release/INSTALL.md) to configure these runtimes and the ignored `configs/runtime/local.toml` file.

```bash
python tools/reproduce.py --tasks L2-02_variant01 --execute
python tools/batch_run.py --summarize runs/PATH_TO_BATCH
```

Without `--execute`, `reproduce.py` prints a plan. It passes each configuration's existing seed, time limit, and call limit explicitly. Use `--suite original`, `--suite variant01`, or `--suite all` to select a complete suite. Offline dry runs check the execution lifecycle; they do not run physics or measure task success.

## Documentation

| Guide | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [Installation](docs/release/INSTALL.md) | Python, Isaac Sim, cuRobo, model access, and local paths |
| [Evaluation protocol](docs/release/PROTOCOL.md) | Task configurations, prompts, budgets, scoring, and recorded outputs |
| [Task numbering](docs/release/TASK_NUMBERING.md) | Current IDs and mappings for historical records |
| [Validation](docs/release/VALIDATION.md) | Asset and software checks, with their scope and limitations |
| [Release guide](docs/release/RELEASE.md) | Source and asset packaging, project page, and provenance |
| [Optional remote deployment](skills/r5-remote-deploy/SKILL.md) | SSH deployment, fleet examples, and verification |

Runs retain configuration snapshots, model requests and replies, observations, actions, scores, and videos. Summaries distinguish task failures, timeouts, interruptions, and infrastructure errors. Real-robot operating conditions and records are documented separately from the simulation runtime.

## Development

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python tools/release/check_task_contract.py
python tools/verify_runtime_assets.py --check-git --usd
```

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/robot_tasks/` | Shared execution, policies, planning, tasks, and evaluators |
| `configs/tasks/` | Original and alternative task configurations |
| `assets/` | Pinned [simulation assets](https://github.com/PhysLadder-Benchmark/PhysLadder-Assets); `runtime.lock.json` records SHA-256 hashes |
| `tools/release/` | Verification, packaging, and initial-state rendering |
| `docs/` | Project-page source and technical documentation |
| `docs/media/` | Optional pinned [website media](https://github.com/PhysLadder-Benchmark/PhysLadder-Media) |

For bug reports, include the task ID, commit, runtime versions, and relevant logs in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/PhysLadder-Benchmark/PhysLadder/issues). Keep credentials, machine settings, and run outputs out of commits. Changes to prompts, scoring, physics, or initial conditions should be identified explicitly so results remain comparable.
